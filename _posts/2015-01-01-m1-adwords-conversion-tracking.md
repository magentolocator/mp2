Adwords Conversion Tracking

When you do e-commerce sites it’s pretty obvious how to track your conversions – they will appear in sales in the Dashboard! However, sometimes you also get asked to add Google Analytics conversion tracking code just because the client wants all their statistics in one place. So the analytics guy will send through a request asking you to place a specific piece of code on the successful transaction ‘Thank You’ page.
