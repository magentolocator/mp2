In the Product Detail, you can upload as many images as you need for a product, simultaneously, link to video, rearrange their order, and determine how each is used. For each product, three roles are available for you to assign to any image. You can set the main image or the base image that must be large enough to produce the magnification that is needed for zoom. Apart from the base image, a small image of that image will appear in product listing, and a thumbnail will be in the shopping cart. The assign is flexible for you, however, by default, these roles are auto-assigned to the first uploaded image.
