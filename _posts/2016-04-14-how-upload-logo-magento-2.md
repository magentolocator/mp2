One of the first things you’ll want to do is to change the logo in the header, and upload a
favicon for the browser. You’ll also want to update the copyright notice in the footer,.
These are a few simple design tasks that you can take care of right away. While your store
is in development, you can turn on the store demo notice, and then remove it when you’re
ready to launch.



## Uploading Your Logo

The size and location of the logo in the header is determined by the store’s theme. Your logo can be saved as either a GIF, PNG, JPG, or SVG file type, and uploaded from the Admin of your store. The default Magento logo in the sample data is an SVG file, which is a scalable XML-based vector graphic format.

The logo image resides in the following location on the server. Any image file with by that
name and at that location is used as the theme logo.

Path: `app/design/frontend/[vendor]/[theme]/web/images/logo.svg`


If you don’t know the size of the logo, or any other image that is used in your theme, open the
page in a browser, right-click the image, and inspect the element.


In addition to the logo in `the header`, your logo also appears on `email templates` and on `PDF invoices` and other `sales documents`. The logos used for email templates and invoices have different size requirements, and must be uploaded separately
