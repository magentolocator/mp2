**Creating a new category** is the essential way to establish the logic flow for your management in the settings. Besides, customers will find the searching on your website professional instead of making the appearances of all items chaos.
 
The category is shown as a big tree with branches in the lower. Each new category created by store owners will be assigned to a relevant parent category. Any unavailable category is hidden with gray. The position of category can be reordered when you drag, hold and drop it to the new location. Moreover, in the top of each category page, the category is marked by an ID number that is next to the category name.

## Customizing Categories

A category configuration is customizable, so you can fix, change its position in the category chart, even eliminate it quickly. However, it is important to examine how your modification will affect on other parts. For instance, if there are some products in the category that you rename, the current product links are unavailable to access. Therefore, you should set your catalog to auto-generate a permanent redirect if there is any change as above. Or you can apply the URL Rewrite tool to navigate the visitors to a new link.

### Rearrange a category

* On the Admin Panel, `Product > Inventory > Categories`
* In the category chart, tap the needed category and drag-drop it to the new parent category. The new structure of category will be auto-saved.

### Eliminate a category

* From the category chart, consider the category you want to eliminate. 

~~~
A eliminated category never comeback, so be careful to select the right category.

* Click on the `Delete Category`, then `Ok` to verify.
