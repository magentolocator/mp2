According to common conception:

Affiliate Marketing is a type of performance-based marketing in which a business rewards one or more Affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by the Affiliate’s marketing efforts.

From that, each person will have thoughts about Affiliate Marketing, and in my opinion, simply: 

*Affiliate Marketing is the marketing between people and Affiliates will receive commission per their customer’s successful purchase.*

In Affiliate Marketing, there are four core players: Merchants, Affiliates, Network, and Customers.

* Merchants (brands/ vendors) are the people who supply products, services, and brand to refer.

* Affiliates (collaborators/ publishers) take a responsibility of referring products to friends. 

* Referred Visitors who are referred by Affiliates and come to buy products.

* The network is where Affiliates and  Customers meet and takes care of the payments.

There is a similar method to Affiliate Marketing, which is Referral Marketing. If not researching deeply, you can make a little mistake because of their form marketing. Both of them use the third parties to advertise and sell. However, in Affiliate Marketing, Affiliates work for vendors due to the commission or financial motivation while the major thing of Referral Marketing is the trust in the vendors and their products.

With the above comparison, you understand in detail partly about the working rule of Affiliate Marketing.
