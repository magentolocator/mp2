The Setup Wizard is a multi-page wizard that enables you to go back and forward one page at a time. You cannot skip pages, and you must enter all required information on every page before you can proceed to the next page.

`http://www.example.com/setup`

- On the initial page, click `Agree and Set Up Magento`.

Continue with the following topics in the order presented to complete the installation.

### Step 1: Readiness Check

Click `Start Readiness Check`.
If any errors display, you must resolve them before you continue. Click More detail if available to see more information about each check.

Click `Next`

### Step 2: Add a Database

Your Store Address: `http://www.example.com`
