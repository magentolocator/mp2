You can have up to five different email addresses to represent distinct functions or departments
for each store or view. In addition to the following predefined email identities, there are two
custom identities that you can set up according to your needs.

- General Contact
- Sales Representative
- Customer Support

Each identity and its associated email address can be associated with specific automated email
messages and appear as the sender of email messages that are sent from your store.
