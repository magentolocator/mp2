When owning a store, there are many kinds of items you can sell them while they are divided into two main types: physical products that might be touched or tasted and non-tangible products such as memberships, services, warranties, or subscriptions. Therefore, Magento 2 platform allows you to release both of them and **Virtual Products** settings will help you create a new non-tangible item without any difficulty.

For example, you want to put Fitness Membership for sale, just configure the virtual products settings to create and sell it easily. The virtual products can be purchased separately or together with some product types like Grouped Product and Bundle Product.
