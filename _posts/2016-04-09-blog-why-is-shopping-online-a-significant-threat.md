  * Money: A payment that is quite usual method is using a credit card. Therefore, you may have risk in transferring money.
  * Delivery problems: Sometimes you can face to failed shipping.

Because of not feeling product directly, you can be unsatisfied when you receive. And you want to change or return them, which is a little complicated to both buyers and sellers.
