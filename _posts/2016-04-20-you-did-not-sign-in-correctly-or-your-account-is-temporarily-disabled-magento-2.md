## You did not sign in correctly or your account is temporarily disabled.


I have been installing via the command line and ran into this problem yesterday, after banging my head off the wall all day, I tried creating a new user via the cli ``./bin/magento admin:user:create`` and thatâ€™s when I noticed an error. I guess usually my random typing contains numbers.

The fix was to make sure there is 1 alpha character and 1 numeric character in the admin password. This should be labelled a bug if the password is not validated during install with ``magento setup:install``


### Password requirements are:

- User Name is a required field.
- First Name is a required field.
- Last Name is a required field.
- Please enter a valid email.
- Password is required field.
- Your password must be at least 7 characters.
- Your password must include both numeric and alphabetic characters.
