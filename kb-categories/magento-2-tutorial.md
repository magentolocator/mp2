title: Magento 2 Tutorial
description: "Magento 2 was released with improved performance and better code base than the previous version. In addition, Magento 2 supports new features to boost conversion rates more effectively, and business agility and productivity improvements. These Magento 2 tutorials cover back and front-end development, as well as administration guides to help you get up and running with Magento 2. For the whole eCommerce community, this is a real boom! Magento 1.x has been around for nearly 10 years and itâ€™s very obvious that it needed either a major update or complete replacement."
